# About My Timer App:
The application is a timer, after which the ringtone plays. You can set the time using the slider (SeekBar), in the range of 10-60 seconds.
With EditText it is possible to set any time.

When the screen is rotated, the View state data is transferred to another screen (horizontal orientation) via the Bundle.
To transfer the ringtone to another screen, use
PARCELIZATION and Bundle!
